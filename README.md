ETL-Project

This project was simple but still took me a while to complete.

I chose two data source: Kagle, and Data.world. From these sources, I found a current NBA rosters as well as 2017 player statistics.
I combined the data in my jupyter notebook file, narrowed down some statistics, dropped unnecessary columns/rows

I used to_sql in order to load my data into a new dataframe called players
